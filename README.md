# E_Waste_Generation_classification
Problem Statement and Description
E-waste (electronic waste) is rapidly becoming a serious environmental and health issue around the world. Proper sorting and categorization of e-waste is essential for efficient recycling and disposal, but manual classification is error-prone and labor-intensive.

This project aims to build an automated e-waste classification system using artificial intelligence and machine learning. By training a deep learning model on images of different types of e-waste, we can identify and categorize them accurately.

Goal:
Use image classification with EfficientNetV2B0 to classify e-waste into 10 distinct categories to support better sorting and recycling automation.
